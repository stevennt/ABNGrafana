= Creating Dynamic Dashboards

Instead of hard-coding specific information (such as node names or resource IDs) in a panel, {product-title} has several ways to create more dynamic and interactive dashboards:

* xref:pc-template-filters[template variables]
* filter panels

[[pc-template-filters]]
== Using Template Variables to Create Dynamic Dashboards

Template variables are available in metric queries and panel titles and appear as a drop-down list at the top of the dashboard.
Select from the list to change the data the panel displays.

There are two queries you can customize:

* specific node(s): `nodeFilter(NODEFILTERSTRING)`

* specific resource(s) on a node: `nodeResources(NODEID)`

This procedure explains how to use variables in a query for a category of nodes (switches). 

. Select or xref:../getting_started/basic_walkthrough.adoc#[create a panel]. 
For this procedure, we created a panel that displays active TCP connections:

. In the top right of the panel, click the dashboard settings icon and choose *Variables>Add variable*.

. Specify the appropriate information, similar to the following. 
A preview of the values returned appears at the bottom of the screen:

.. Supported queries are in the form `nodeFilter($filter)` or `nodeResource(FS:FID)` where `$filter` is any filter expression.
In this case, we used the `nodeFilter` variable to specify the nodes in the category "switches". 

. Click *Add*.
. Click *Save*. 

=== Specify a Node Variable in the Panel
After creating the template variable, you need to update the panel to make sure data is available from all the nodes rather than a specific one, as originally configured.

. In the panel, type `$node` in the *Node* field.
. Update the label to make it unique by typing the following: `nodeToLabel($node)`.
.. A label must be unique to display data in the panel.

. Save your dashboard. 
. Click the *Node* drop-down you created to select the nodes whose data you want to display:

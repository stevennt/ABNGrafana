= Flow Datasource

== General

The _Flow Datasource_ can be used to retrieve application and conversation related metrics derived from flow data stored by OpenNMS.

The query editor supports the following functions:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Category  | Name                    | Description
| Combine   | `topN`                  | Limit the results to the Top N conversations/applications when sorted by total bytes.
| Combine   | `includeOther`          | Combine and include other conversations/applications that fall outside of the Top N.
| Filter    | `withExporterNode`      | Filter for flows related to the given exporter node.
| Filter    | `withIfIndex`           | Filter for flows related to the given interface index.
| Transform | `toBits`                | Convert the values from bytes to bits.
| Transform | `perSecond`             | Convert the values to a per/second rate.
| Transform | `negativeEgress`        | Make the egress values negative.
| Transform | `negativeIngress`       | Make the ingress values negative.
| Transform | `asTableSummary`        | Generate a tabular summary instead of time series data.
| Transform | `combineIngressEgress`  | Sum ingress and egress values together.
| Transform | `onlyIngress`           | Only display ingress traffic.
| Transform | `onlyEgress`            | Only display egress traffic.
| Transform | `withGroupByInterval`   | Changes the resolution of the returned datapoints grouping by the given time
interval (in the format of: 10s, 5m, 1h, etc.)

== Template Queries

=== exporterNodesWithFlows

The `exporterNodesWithFlows()` query will return a list of nodes which have exported flow data to OpenNMS.
The value of the template variable is the `Node ID` and the display text is the `Node Label`.

NOTE: The exporters must be part of the node inventory in OpenNMS in order to be returned by this query.

For example, to query the exporters that have sent flows you can use the following expression:
```
exporterNodesWithFlows()
```

=== interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows

The `interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows()` query will return a list of interface indexes which are associated with one or more flows on the given node.
The value of the template variable is the `Interface Index` and the display text is the `Interface Name`.

The available arguments are as follows:
[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name                 | Default     | Description
| nodeCriteria         | `(none)`    | Node criteria (Node ID, or Node Foreign Souce and Node Foreign ID) of the node on which to enumerate the interfaces.
|===

Assuming that the `$node` variable is populated with a value from the `exporterNodesWithFlows` query, you can use the following expression:
```
interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows($node)
```

To query a specific node by id, you can use an expression similar to:
```
interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows(123)
```

To query a specific node by foreign source and foreign id, you can use an expression similar to:
```
interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows(FS:FID)
```

== Limitations

The flow datasource only supports a single query per panel.

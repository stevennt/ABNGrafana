== Overview

This guide helps migrate an existing installation of Grafana from using the OpenNMS Data Source plugin to using {product-title} to interface with OpenNMS.

The tutorial assumes that you have:

- an instance of Grafana with the OpenNMS Data Source installed.
- a data source configured with type OpenNMS, and one or more dashboards using the data source.

[[mig-install]]
== Installation

Both the OpenNMS Data Source plugin and {product-title} can be installed at the same time while you complete the migration.

If you have not already done so, you may install {product-title} using your prefered method.
See xref:../welcome/index.adoc#welcome-installing[Installing {product-title}] for detailed instructions.

[[mig-app-setup]]
== Application Setup

Once {product-title} is installed, you need to enable the application in Grafana to make the provided panels and data sources available:

. Navigate to the http://127.0.0.1:3000/[home page] of your Grafana instance.
In the top-left corner of the page, click on the Grafana icon, and then click *Plugins*:

. Next, navigate to the `Apps` tab, and click on the `OpenNMS Helm` application.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the `OpenNMS Helm` is application is not listed on the `Apps` tab, try restarting the Grafana server.
If the issue persists, make sure the application is installed correctly.
====

. Enable the application by clicking on the `Enable` button.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you see a `Disable` button, then the application is already enabled and you can skip to the next step.

[[mig-convert-ds]]
== Migrating Data Sources

Once the {product-title} application is enabled, you can convert your existing `OpenNMS` data sources to use the `OpenNMS Perfomance` type.
When switching the type, you may need to re-enter the URL and authentication details.

NOTE: {product-title} provides two data source types.
The `OpenNMS Performance` type is equivalent to the previous `OpenNMS` data source.

[[mig-verify]]
== Verify Dashboards

Once the existing data sources have been converted to use the new `OpenNMS Performance` type, you should verify your existing dashboards to make sure they continue to render properly.

If you encounter any errors when switching, you can revert to the previous data source type.

[[mig-plugin-removal]]
== Plugin Removal

Once you have verified that your dashboards continue to work with the new data source, you can remove the previous plugin.

Use the `grafana-cli` tool to remove the `OpenNMS Data Source` plugin from the commandline:

[source, shell]
----
sudo grafana-cli plugins remove opennms-datasource
----

Restart Grafana for the plugin to be completely unregistered:

[source, shell]
----
sudo service grafana-server restart
----

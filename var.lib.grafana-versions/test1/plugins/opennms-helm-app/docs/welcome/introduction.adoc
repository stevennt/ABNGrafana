= What is {product-title}?

{product-title} is an application that allows users to create flexible dashboards to interact with data stored by OpenNMS. {product-title} works with https://grafana.com[Grafana], an analytics platform, to display and customize xref:fault[fault management (_FM_)] and xref:performance[performance management (PM)] data from https://www.opennms.org[OpenNMS(R) Horizon(TM)] and/or https://www.opennms.com[OpenNMS(R) Meridian(TM)]. Create and customize dashboards to display the data you want to see -- alarms, outages, key performance indicators -- in a way that best meets the needs of your workflow and staff.

== How does it work?

{product-title} includes datasources for retrieving both _FM_ and _PM_ data from an existing OpenNMS deployment as well as specialized panels to display and interact with the faults. The ability to aggregate data from multiple instances of OpenNMS allows operators to build a single pane of glass from distributed deployments.

All interactions with OpenNMS are done via the _REST API_.
No _FM_ or _PM_ data is stored within {product-title} or Grafana.

[[fault]]
== Fault Management

Fault management (_FM_) is the process of identifying problems (or faults) related to network devices and systems, and managing their lifecycle. OpenNMS can do this using a combination of events, outages, alarms, notifications, tickets, etc.

{product-title} supports filtering, retrieving, displaying and performing actions against *alarms in OpenNMS*.

[[performance]]
== Performance Management

Performance management (_PM_) is the process of gathering, storing, and analyzing system health using a series of metrics or key performance indicators (_KPIs_).
These metrics can be used for historical analysis, or to automatically generate faults when certain conditions or thresholds are met.

{product-title} supports retrieving and visualizing *metric data (measurements) that OpenNMS stores*.

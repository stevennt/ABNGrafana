= Building with Docker

== Simple Build

The source can be compiled from source with a Docker builder image.

```
docker build -t myopennmshelmimage .
```

will checkout the source from GitHub URL of the project, compile and installs the plugin.
The result is a runnable image which can be executed with

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -t myopennmshelmimage
```

Login on http://your-ip:3000 with login admin:admin and go to Plugins and enable the Helm app.

IMPORTANT: The plugin directory location is changed from `/var/lib/grafana/plugins` to `/opt/grafana/plugins` because the base grafana image defines the `/var/lib/grafana` as a _VOLUME_ which can't be changed.

== Advanced Build

If you want to build an image based on a specific GitHub fork or branch you can use `--build-arg`:

```
docker build -t mycustomforkbranch \
            --build-arg OPENNMS_HELM_GIT_URL=https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms-helm.git \
            --build-arg OPENNMS_HELM_GIT_BRANCH_REF=myBranch
```

This will create the plugin from the given GitHub URL and branch.

== Using Docker Compose to Build a Service Stack

There is an example `docker-compose.yml` which builds a whole service stack with a compiled _Grafana OpenNMS Helm App_ which can be tested.

Modify the build arguments in the `docker-compose.yml` if you want to build from a GitHub fork, branch or version tag.

With first running `docker-compose up -d` the _Grafana OpenNMS Helm App_ will be compiled from source.
Any run will use the compiled image from on the local system.
If you want to rebuild the image run `docker-compose build --no-cache` to rebuild the image with the build configuration in the given `docker-compose.yml`.

The URL for the data source in Grafana for the OpenNMS Horizon server is `http://opennms:8980/opennms`.

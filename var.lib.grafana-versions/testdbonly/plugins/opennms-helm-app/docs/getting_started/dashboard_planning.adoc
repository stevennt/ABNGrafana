= Planning your dashboard

[.lead]
Every network is unique, with different monitoring requirements. 
{product-title} has the flexibility to enable users to customize dashboards to display data in a way that best meets their needs and workflow. 

A dashboard you create in {product-title} will contain multiple panels, each of which displays specific data. 
For example, the following sample dashboard displays performance metrics collected via SNMP.

Another dashboard might display traffic flows:

Taking the time to consider what data you want to display and how to organize it can save time and effort when creating dashboards in {product-title}.

When planning your dashboard, consider the following:

* type of data (faults, performance, flows, inventory)
* workflow (What is the best way to organize the data? By type, location, devices, staff responsibility, etc.?)
* staff (Who is responsible and how are issues addressed? Who should have access to what data?)

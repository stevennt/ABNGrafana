= Installing on RPM-based Linux (CentOS, Fedora, OpenSuse, RedHat)

[IMPORTANT]
====
These instructions assume that https://grafana.com[Grafana] is NOT already installed on the target system.
If you have an existing instance of https://grafana.com[Grafana] you would like to use, refer to xref:../installation/plugin.adoc#[Installing via plugin].
====

== Install stable

Install the package repository:

[source, shell]
----
sudo yum install https://yum.opennms.org/repofiles/opennms-repo-stable-rhel7.noarch.rpm
sudo rpm --import https://yum.opennms.org/OPENNMS-GPG-KEY
----

Install the packages:

[source, shell]
----
sudo yum install opennms-helm
----

== Start the server (init.d service)

You can start Grafana by running:

[source, shell]
----
sudo service grafana-server start
----

This will start the `grafana-server` process as the `grafana` user,
which is created during package installation. The default HTTP port is
`3000`, and default user and group is `admin`.

To configure the Grafana server to start at boot time:

[source, shell]
----
sudo /sbin/chkconfig --add grafana-server
----

== Start the server (via systemd)

[source, shell]
----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
sudo systemctl status grafana-server
----

=== Enable the systemd service to start at boot

[source, shell]
----
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server.service
----
